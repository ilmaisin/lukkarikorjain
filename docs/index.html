<p>This website used to host a script that fixed the iCalendar 
output of the Mimosa scheduling software used at Turku University of 
Applied Sciences. This service is discontinued because it is not useful
with the new scheduling software Peppi.</p>

<p>As of October 2018, the new scheduling software is available and
feature-complete. Downloading of the schedules in the iCalendar format 
is possible for logged-in users. A continuously updating feed is not 
available, though. If the schedule is changed, the user needs to
re-download the .ics file.</p>

The source code of the script is available at the <a href="https://github.com/ilmaisin/lukkarikorjain">Github page</a>.
